# Salinibacter_ruber_01
Repository for the first part of my Salinibacter ruber study.
- 00_Working_Notes.txt outlines the ordered steps I executed for the analysis.
- 00_PBS contains scripts I used with the qsub server on PACE at GA Tech.
- 00_Scripts contains all the python (v3.6+) scripts written for this analysis.\
Use information for the python scripts can be found by executing scriptname.py -h
- 00_Run_Pangenome_Experiment contains both PBS and Python scripts to randomly select genomes, calculate ANI with fastANI, predict genes with Prodigal, compute gene clusters with CD-HIT, and build some Pangenome plots.

The file names in 00_Working_Notes.txt should match the file names of the scripts.
